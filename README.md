# [I]mages
I do a lot of programming playing with image processing, and creating algorithmic art
or doing visually based simulations (RandomWalks, Automata, etc.). To facilitate the
process of creating these programs I'm creating the ``imutils.py`` library of image
related functions I frequently use. This should be useful, and helpful for developing
more robust and logical image related projects on a larger scale. 

## Alpha *{Low_Quality Text Rendering}*
![text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylersDurden/insight/master/TextRendering.png)

Pretty Crude, but takes text with any characters (A-Z) and
renders an image of the equivalent text. It also adds a newline
if there's enough words in the text input.

## imutils
This library of useful image related functions covers quite a lot of utilities that
makes later programming much more concise. Here's an overview of what imutils holds:
