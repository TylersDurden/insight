# [I]mages
I do a lot of programming playing with image processing, and creating algorithmic art
or doing visually based simulations (RandomWalks, Automata, etc.). To facilitate the
process of creating these programs I'm creating the ``imutils.py`` library of image
related functions I frequently use. This should be useful, and helpful for developing
more robust and logical image related projects on a larger scale. 

# imutils
This library of useful image related functions covers quite a lot of utilities that
makes later programming much more concise. Here's an overview of what imutils holds:
